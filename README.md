# ATM-TRANSACTIONS-THROUGH-BIOMETRIC-MODE
Money transactions play a vital role in the nature of trade. Today, ATMs and Credit cards are used for this purpose, the authentication of these transactions are unsecure. To overcome this shortcoming of piracy in money transactions, the author proposes the idea of using fingerprints of customers as password in place of traditional pin number. Here, if the fingerprint is recognized, then it allows transaction. This model has an additional feature i.e., a reference fingerprint of the nominee or a close family member of the customer can be used if the customer is not available in case of emergencies. As the fingerprint of every person is unique and unchangeable, this biometric feature is used over the others. Internet shopping, a strong alternative to traditional “go, see, touch and buy” shopping, has been one of the mostly used facilities of the Internet. Security in online payment systems has been a wide research area since the early days of the Internet and several approaches have been devised by various Organizations. But, none of the system overcomes the Weakness in those systems. Several online shopping systems serve internet users all around the world and enable people to get the products they need with a small effort.
